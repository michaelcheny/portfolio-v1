        God? God's turning people into insect monsters Beth. I'm the one beating them to death. Thank me.
        Nobody's killing me until after I catch my wife with another man. Listen to your sister Morty; to
        live is to risk it all; otherwise you're just an inert chunk of randomly assembled molecules
        drifting wherever the universe blows you. Oh, I'm sorry, Jerry, I didn't see you there, how much
        of that did you hear? Do you know how many characters there are in the Simpsons Morty? There's
        like a-a billion characters, M-Morty. There was an episode where Former President BUSH was their
        neighbor!
