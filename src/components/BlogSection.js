          Oh, we're welllll past that, Jerry! Looks like some sort of legally safe knockoff of an '80s
          horror character with miniature swords for fingers instead of knives! I ain't better than shit,
          Jack! Holy crap, Morty, run! Run for your life, Morty, run! I-I've never seen that thing before
          in my life, Morty, I don't even know what the hell it is! We-we gotta get out of here, Morty,
          it's gonna kill us! We're gonna die, Morty! We're gonna die!

          Rick?! Congratulations! You're just as arrogant and just as irresponsible! I going to daughter
