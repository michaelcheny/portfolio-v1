        Well, to be honest, I'm kind of grossed out with the sexual nature of how everything unfolded. I
        didn't know how sexual dragons were. I kind of just wanted to do some D&D stuff, y'know? I've
        replaced them both as the de facto patriarch of your family and your universe. Your mom wouldn't
        have accepted me if I came home without you and your sister, so now you know the real reason I
        rescued you. I just took over the family, Morty! And if you tell your mom or sister I said any of
        this, I'll deny it, and they'll take my side because I'm a hero, Morty! And now you're gonna have
        to go and do whatever I say, Morty! Forever! An-and I-I-I'll go out and I'll find some more of
        that Mulan szechuan teriyaki dipping sauce, Morty! Th-b-because that's what this is all about
        Morty! Th-that's my one-armed man! I'm not driven by avenging my dead family, Morty, that was
        fake! I-I-I'm driven by finding that mcnuggut sauce! I want that Mulan mcnuggut sauce, Morty!
        That's my series arc, Morty! If it takes nine seasons, I want my mcnuggut dipping sauce szechuan
        sauce, Morty! That's what's gon-it's gonna take us all the way to the end, Morty! Season nine
        more seasons, Morty! Nine more seasons until I get that dipping szechuan sauce! For ninety-seven
        more years, Morty! I want that mcnuggut sauce Morty! Whoa, spoilers! I'm a whole season behind.
        You look it up, you don't- you don't even know what it means. Those guys are inside you building
        a piece of shit Ethan! They're inside you building a monument to compromise! Fuck them, fuck
        those people, fuck this whole thing Ethan. Oh, that's Million Ants. I can't see the ants from
        over here, I just assumed that was um.. Turd Man, Wiggly Turd Man. The trick to cereal is keeping
        70% of it above the milk. "And"? What more do you want tacked on to this? I turned myself into a
        pickle, and 9/11 was an inside job?"
